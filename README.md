## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project implements a **time and humidity measurement system** using an Arduino board and sensors.  
Instead of using physical hardware, the project is **fully simulated** in [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/), allowing development and testing without actual microcontrollers.  
Although the course topics were not directly about embedded systems, this project was completed as part of the final coursework effort, focusing on:  
- Writing structured C++ code for Arduino using PlatformIO.
- Simulating hardware behavior with Wokwi.
- Using Python for data collection and plotting diagrams.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
#### Option 1 - Run on Wokwi
1. Open [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/)
1. Create a new Arduino project. 
1. Copy the contents of `src/main.cpp` into the Wokwi editor.  
1. Upload `diagram.json` to define the circuit connections.  
1. Start the simulation.

#### Option 2 - Run Locally with PlatformIO
1. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the **PlatformIO** extension.  
2. Clone this repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmirMohammad-Sharbati/computer-structure-course-project.git
cd arduino-time-humidity
```  
3. Open the project in VSCode.
4. Build and upload to the simulator

#### ðŸ’¡ Tip:
- **Option 2 (PlatformIO) is recommended** for this project because it allows integration with the Python plotting script. If your project only includes C++ code, the online Wokwi simulator is a simpler and faster option.
